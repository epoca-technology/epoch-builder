# Model Evaluation
# Evaluation performed right after the model is trained in order to get an overview of the
# potential accuracy, as well as the prediction type distribution.
# The evaluation works similarly to the backtests and it is only performed on the test
# dataset to ensure the model has not yet seen it.
